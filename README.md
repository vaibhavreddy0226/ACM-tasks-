### 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to all the tasks completed by me as part of the **ACM S3 Web Development Club Entry Process**.

🔧 It's a collection of hands-on web dev challenges, creative exercises, and learning experiences.

📁 Each folder (like `Task-01`, `Task-02`, etc.) contains well-documented code and a summary of what I’ve learned.
